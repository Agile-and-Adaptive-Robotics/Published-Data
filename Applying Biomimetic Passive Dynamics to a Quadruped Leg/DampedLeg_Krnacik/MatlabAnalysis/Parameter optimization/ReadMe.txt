DYNAMIC PROPERTIES CALC
Was used to calculate risetime in the hip, and frequency and damping ratio in the knee for rat trials


OPTIMIZER FUNCTIONS AND DATA
These are miscellaneous scripts need to run the optimizers.
Includes cost calculations, joint angle data, EOM, mechanical properties of the systems, etc.

OPTIMIZER SCRIPTS
Optimization scripts used to calculate dynamic properties of rat trials and robot leg.

RESULTS
Optimization results, sorted into folders.
Generally a data file and a figure are saved for each optimization.

TRIAL PLOTTING
Plotting of the rat leg trials used, as joint angle data over time.
